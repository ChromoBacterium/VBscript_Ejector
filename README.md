# VBscript_Ejector_Virus
A CD/DVD ejector and "virus" written in Visual Basic. The ejector is not my code, but one I found online.
# How to Use It
Clone the repo, and run the Batchfile (Document.bat).
Great for pranks.
# How to Kill Process
Your computer will shut down anyways. Need I say more?
# What won't you be responsible for any damages?
This is "virus" is meant to be a safe-and stupid-prank program. I only wrote it. I did not deploy it (other than my own computer).
