# VBscript_Ejector
A CD/DVD ejector and "virus" written in Visual Basic. The ejector is not my code, but one I found online.
# How to Use It
Clone the repo, or copy and paste the code (Project.vbs) in a text editor. Save the file as a .vbs file, and run.
Great for pranks.
# How to Kill Process
Restart your computer. Need I say more?
